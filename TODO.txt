need header with all the enums we know of
(from libtf2mod, source sdk const.h, etc)

copy over the in-progress bot spy detection code
(make separate dirs for the 20130214 version and the current version)

create skeletons for classes:
CUpgrades
CMannVsMachineStats
CMannVsMachineUpgradeManager
CMannVsMachineUpgrades
CTFObjectiveResource (partial)
CTFGameRules (partial)
CTFPlayer (partial)
CTFBot
CTFBotHint
CTFBotHintEngineerNest
CTFBotHintSentryGun
CTFBotHintTeleporterExit
CTFBotRoster
CTFBotManager
CTFBaseBoss
CTFTankBoss
CTFMannVsMachineLogic
CTFPowerupBottle
tf_revive


make skeleton for all NextBot AI behaviors/actions


also RE all the nb_, tf_bot_, bot_ cvars

CSpawnLocation
non-virtual
::ctor
::Parse
::SelectSpawnArea
::FindSpawnLocation
00 enum
   1 = Ahead
   2 = Behind
   3 = Anywhere
04 CUtlVector<CHandle<CBaseEntity>>

MAKE SURE THAT CUtlVector includes:
- m_pElements @ 0x10
- sizeof == 0x14

LOOK AT https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking/blob/master/BuildbotPaths/tf/server.txt
for pretty much ALL of the relevant source code file paths

classes that are in osx server.dylib but not in linux server_srv.so:
- CAmmoFilter

make a GIGANTIC awesome flowgraph, basically a finite state machine diagram
- nodes are the actions
- edges are CHANGE_TO, SUSPEND_FOR, DONE (hrm, that may be hard...)

for each CTFBot action, document whether it is ever used in MvM mode
